# Code Refactor/Accessabilty Project


I changed the title name from "website" to something more specific. I grouped bunch of images and texts together in CSS when they have same format or font size. I made sure the header attricutes are sequential by making h2 under footer to h4. I removed bunch of "div" and changed it  to more semantic meaning item such as "footer" or "section". the html is semantic structure now which includes header, title, hero image, 2 sections and footer. instead of having the hero image in css, i moved it to html which is more semantic.  link of webpage: https://qzou39.github.io/module_1_accessibility_standards/
